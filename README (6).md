# ⚛️ Relativity Using Massless Waves in Medical Imaging
We've conducted a proposal about using massless waves in medical imaging, which involved breaking the law of conservation of energy **_E=mc<sup>2</sup>_** as we put an assumed 
threshold the current technologies can deal with.<br><br>
Our proposal is divided to the following:
- Introduction to the idea.
- The broken law and the specific threshold we assumed.
- The mechanism we wish to apply according to that broken law.
- The benefits of our new insight.
- the real-life drawbacks that prevent us from implementing the idea.
- And lastly, a section for the research papers we were inspired by.
  
We've also produced an animated infographic video to express the idea more ..
